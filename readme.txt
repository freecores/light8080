I have included the original documentation for the SCS-1 monitor program used 
in the core demo, because it is quite difficult to find in the internet.

The test bench programs have been assembled with DOS TASM (Telemark Assembler)
freely available at http://home.comcast.net/~tasm/.

The demo SCS1 program was assembled with CP/M's ASM, running on the 
SIMH 8080/Z80 emulator available at http://simh.trailing-edge.com. 
CP/M software and disk images are available in the above site and elsewhere 
on the internet.
